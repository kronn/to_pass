== Transformation of a String to a Password.

Passwords should be easy to remember and hard to guess.

One technique is to have a sentence which can be easily remembered transformed to a password.

ToPwd::Integration provides a to_pwd Method which transforms a sentence to a password.

Currently, only two algorithms are provided. But they are YAML-Files, so it's extensible.

== Usage

=== IRB

irb> require 'lib/to_pwd'
irb> String.send(:include, ToPwd::Integration)
irb> "Da steht ein Pferd auf dem Flur".to_pwd
=> "Ds1P@dF"

=== CLI

$ cd path/to/to_pwd
$ bin/to_pwd "test"   # => t35t
$ bin/to_pwd "there is one problem for us, too" -a basic_en # => ti1p4u2

=== CLI with Pipes

This example is Mac OSX-centric, but you should get the point

$ cd path/to/to_pwd
$ echo "test" | bin/to_pwd | pbcopy

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
