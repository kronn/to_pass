== Transformation of a String to a Password.

Passwords should be easy to remember and hard to guess.  One technique is to
have a sentence which can be easily remembered transformed to a password.

This library encapsulates that and satisfies different usage scenarios.
Currently, only two algorithms are provided. But they are YAML-Files, so it's
extensible.

== Usage

=== IRB

ToPass::Integration provides a to_pass Method which transforms a sentence to a
password.

  irb> require 'lib/to_pass'
  irb> String.send(:include, ToPass::Integration)
  irb> "Da steht ein Pferd auf dem Flur".to_pass
  # => "Ds1P@dF"

=== CLI

  $ to_pass "test"   # => t35t
  $ to_pass "there is one problem for us, too" -a basic_en # => ti1p4u2

=== CLI with Pipes

This example is Mac OSX-centric, but you should get the point.

  $ echo "test" | to_pass | pbcopy

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a
  commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
