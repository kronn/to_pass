  # The Converters-class is a collection of available
  # Transformations. Every method is given a string as single argument
  # and is expected to return a transformed string. The only exception
  # from this is general rule is the replace method which also takes a
  # replacement table.
  #
  # This enables chaining and eases extending the capabilities.
