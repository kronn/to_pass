CURRENT
============================================================================
- make it debian compatible (most of which is common sense anyway)
  http://pkg-ruby-extras.alioth.debian.org/upstream-devs.html
  ✓ Distribute your software as a source code archive
    github allows that

  - Use setup.rb
    http://github.com/proutils/setup

  ✓ Remove all references to rubygems in the software you ship
  ✓ Don’t make your Rakefile depend on RubyGems

  - Make your tests and examples usable outside of your directory tree
    this might be achieved by using setup.rb anyway...

  ✓ Use a shebang that works everywhere
  ✓ Provide man pages for your binaries
  ✓ If possible, maintain a backward-compatible API
