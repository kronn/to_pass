RELEASE HISTORY

v0.9.0 / 2011-02-01

tag v0.9.0 (Matthias Viehweger <kronn@kronn.de>)

Changes:

* 9 General Enhancements

    * IM IN UR PROJEKTZ, WATHCIN UR TESTZ
    * made the filename optional and added some hard-coded defaults
    * make default algorithm configurable in ~/.to_pass/config
    * added a ConfigReader which can read the built-in configuration and (later on) user-supplied configurations
    * added a basic file_reader-class which will be the basis for the algorithm- and converterreader
    * added a note on how to make a gem purely optional (and, by accident) not installable through bundle install
    * starting .to_passrc-feature
    * added ability to output available algorithms and converters
    * The test can now be run separated from the source-tree, thereby only testing the library itself. This is useful if you want to package the library, and reorganize the directory structure.

    * moved code around
    * moved converter-testing into the right test-class
    * moved configuration testing into its own test class
    * changed ConverterReader to be a subclass of FileReader

    * moved output of converters into Cli-class
    * moved output of algorithms into Cli-class
