HEAD / 2010-09-03

Version 0.7.0 is mostly a cleanup and compatibility release.

ToPass now runs seamlessly with Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, REE 2010-02. Rubinius works
mostly, but has some issues.

The Metainformation like version, summary, description and the likes are now
all in the version.rb-file. This way, they can be queried easier.

The test can now be run through the test/all.rb-script. In fact, this is the
standard way and internally used by `rake test`. The Manpages are now in the
right location for setup.rb and RDocs now include the LICENSE and this
CHANGELOG.

The gemspec has the filelist now directly from git instead from the
filesystem.
